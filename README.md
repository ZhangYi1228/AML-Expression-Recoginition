#AML-Expression-Recoginition
## The cnn.py is in folder models, which contains the network we designed based on Xception
## In LBP folder, we realized three kinds of LBP
## In data-pro folder, this contains the code for data-processing,including data augmentation,data analysis, comparisons, convert FER2013 to FER2013 PLUS and so on.
## Three train files are train_plus.py, train_emotion_classifer.py and train_ck.py 
## Some other are files for ploting figures, accuracy figure, confusion matrix and so on. 
## And some work about the tool UI, we successfully realized the basic tool to use the model to recoginize us by the camera. This like an extra work so is not very relvant, but interesting and satisfactory. in the future we may do more work to make the tool better.
## the result of our trained model is great, even to be excellent. almost being the highest accuracy(for example, in CK+ dataset we got 96.72% accuracy) of the algorithms existing in the world to recoginize the expression. we are pround of our work.
